How to set up your Windows 10+ OS to install SageMath in a secure and simple manner?

We use Microsoft recommended process to get Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

Then take it step by step with a rather involved process (that is Windows build dependent)

Finally we install SageMath from source as it is the only secure way to install inside Ubuntu 20.10 in WSL2 within Windows.

The directories contain some markdown files and screenshots to guide you.

If you do not want to come to the computer labs then you can make your Windows laptops set up for this and other courses that expect a Linux environemnt.

This should help prepare you and your personal machine (laptop/desktop) for Assignment 3 Problem 0 with just 1 Point.
The Assignment involves installing SageMath from source in your OS according to instructions in your individual Assignment 3 with guidance from:

- [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html)

Here are some sequences of screenshots in my trial Windows system, as they may be a guide for installation and running in yours:

- [Setting up SageMath in WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows after installing WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 -> 20.10](images/settingUpSageMathInWSL2UbuntuOnWindows)
- [Running SageMath in WSL2 Ubuntu after Installation and building](images/runningSageMathInWSL2UbuntuAfterInstall)

Note that the above sequences of screenshots are somewhat circuitous at times as I did mistakes and corrected them as I learnt about them. The idea is that this is a realistic installation, building and running scenario.

You may run into other issues on your Windows build. It is important to read the messages, documentation, and follow by trial and error the path towards installing Windows Sub-system for Linux in your Windows laptop so you can do SageMath, Python and other modern software engineering best practices that is required for data science and mathematical programming.
